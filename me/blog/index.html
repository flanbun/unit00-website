                    Hello, welcome to my blog! This is where I write about, well, myself. It's nothing too interesting, but I don't mind if you take a read. This is mostly just for me to have somewhere to write. I have a weird disorder (not actually, haha) where I need people to see my emotions to feel validated, so I will do that by posting here.

                    I'm at the tail end of my second semester in college, about to finish my 'first year' here - excluding the summer semester that's starting in three weeks or so. I'll have a week or two of break before I'm thrust back into an academic nightmare, but I'll enjoy my downtime while I can. It's brutal out here.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I recently went on a trip to the American midwest with my boyfriend to meet some of his family and to watch the solar eclipse. I had a lot of fun - I wasn't expecting to fare so well socially as sociability isn't a trait I particularly excel in, but I got along really awesomely with everyone I wanted to get along with. The eclipse itself was mesmerizing and provided a lot of inspiration for an original universe I'm working on, but I think I was more interested in the goat cheese we were eating at the time. In hindsight, I probably should have been paying more attention in the moments leading up to totality.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The trip is most likely the most enjoyable event I've experienced this semester besides one of my best friends from home coming to visit for a few days. Grade-wise I've been alright, but I'm really dreading writing two final papers for two different classes, both of which are due in the next week.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I will be fine in the end, though. I'm having fun overall. Hopefully, life will get... less stressful? We'll see... （；´д｀）ゞ

                <p>Hello diary, I'm back. I don't really know if I want to use proper grammar or not. Usually, I really have
                    only typed in lowercase, but as I've grown older I've started to capitalize my phrases more and more. I'm
                    not sure if it's a sign of maturity or not. I think I'm just growing into a different person. <img
                        src="https://files.catbox.moe/aysu5e.gif"></p>
                <p>That is honestly kind of a scary thing to say. I've been thinking about growing up a lot lately, moreso than
                    I usually do. I'm unsure if I touched upon this in the last entry, but I definitely at least said something
                    similar. Coming to terms with growing up is something I've really grappled with since I gained
                    consciousness, really. I don't know what it means to be an adult. And I understand - all adults are just
                    children pretending to know what they're doing, or at least that's what people, but that doesn't change that
                    I still feel unprepared to go out into the world on my own.</p>
                <p>I recently discovered that the Chiikawa theme song is on Spotify, and just today I've listened to it
                    twenty-seven times. Chiikawa is a Japanese children's show starring a little bear and his two best friends,
                    a yellow rabbit and a cat with blue ears, playing out in the forest and going on little adventures. I am
                    fond of it, despite not having the time to watch it regularly. This isn't a particularly anomalous
                    occurrence; I don't have the time to watch TV at all. And I think that is part of what tears me up most
                    about it.</p>
                <p>Ignorance and naivety are two traits that I admire deeply. I want to be stupid and small again. I very often
                    wish I was a little bear running about with a rabbit and a cat by my side, both of whom are equally clueless
                    about the world's many cruelties: loans, grades, and the job market.</p>
                <p class="blockquote">What, is it already morning? I'm talking to myself. I spread butter on the toasted
                    bread...

                    hello diary. this is my first entry into you.
                </p>
                <p>
                    i don't think i'm going to make this a daily thing or anything, just because i don't have enough time to
                    write or even enough notable things going on in my life to discuss. but i will try to update this...
                    somewhat regularly, as in not leave this page hanging for more than a few weeks.
                </p>
                <p>
                    anyway... to the entry! i've been doing kind of badly recently and i'm not really sure where all of it's
                    coming from. i'm vaguely aware of one of the sources - an unfulfilled, constant, stinging longing for my
                    childhood - but that's always plagued me, so i'm not sure why now would be much different...
                </p>
                <p>
                    i'll be okay in the end, though, regardless of how things might be now. that's always been my
                    philosophy: things will always be okay in the end, and if they aren't okay, then it's not the end. i
                    think it's a pretty great philosophy to go by, and it's gotten me through many very difficult times.
                </p>
                <p>
                    for now, here is a list of things i am grateful for: <b>my boyfriend, Whole Foods' $3 strawberry
                        shortcake cups, my new loft bed, the rain, oil pastels, and rei ayanami/kaworu nagisa's monologue in
