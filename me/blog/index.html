                    I had my final exam for the class I'm taking this summer this morning, and well, let's just say this might be the lowest grade I will ever get! Whatever. Another one for the record books. I lowkey was stressing out really badly over it right after but now I don't care (allegedly). There are more, better things in life.
                </p>

                    This weekend I went to the beach with my lovely boyfriend wife. :) It was so awesome. It was a bit chilly so I couldn't really submerge myself in the water because I'd get egregiously cold very quickly to the point of numbing - yuck! The water shouldn't be that cold at 75 degrees Fahrenheit...
                </p>
                <p>
                    I'm supposed to go to the beach again this Friday with my roommates though - the heat wave is going to hit us pretty hard. It's supposed to be over 100 degrees, so hopefully that will make a saltwater bath seem a lot more tempting! I am excited to wear my bikini out. Growing up, I always had a lot of body image issues (I am recovering, sort of, from an ED) but I think I am happy enough with the way I look now to feel confident and even attractive in a swimsuit. Yay! Just maybe not in front of my family - it makes me feel a little awkward, for whatever reason.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I also have been really enjoying my job! I recently got my first paycheck and it is... way more than I thought, so I am quite happy about that, but to be honest, it's less about the money (though that's a perk). My coworkers are all so <em>SWEET!!!!</em> I think I get along really well with all of them, and that they genuinely enjoy my company. We had a work dinner the other night at a very pricy Brazilian steakhouse (you can probably guess which) and as I left, they all said goodbye to me so gingerly. I'm hanging out with one of them tonight, actually!! :D
                </p>
                <p>
                    Ah... life is better than how it was when I wrote my last entry, I think! Crazy how so much can change in two weeks, LOL. I feel better. The horrors aren't over yet but they will be soon. :)

                    Hello, welcome to my blog! This is where I write about, well, myself. It's nothing too interesting, but I don't mind if you take a read. This is mostly just for me to have somewhere to write. I have a weird disorder (not actually, haha) where I need people to see my emotions to feel validated, so I will do that by posting here.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Some entries may be... excessively pessimistic. No matter what I write here, please don't be worried about me - I am pretty great at self-regulation. :)

                    Entries dealing with sensitive topics (S/H, suicide, death, etc.) will be marked as such. Please watch out! Thank you!! :)

                    Hi diary. I am doing really badly. Things seem to keep going wrong - people upset at me for reasons I wasn't previously aware of, and thus acting in accordance without me really knowing the reason why (until, of course, it's revealed to me much later than it should be). As you can expect, I have felt pretty fucking bad about all of that, so I'm not quite sure what to do with myself.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I put a lot of pressure on myself to be a good person. Perhaps the most character-defining and mental illness-inducing incident in my life involved people talking about me behind my back, so it's always been a sore spot to me. Logically - I don't really care, because everyone will always talk shit about anyone, but emotionally it just reopens a wound.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Ok. Timeskip actually. I started sobbing hysterically mid-entry, then walked around for a bit, cried more in the bathroom, and then texted my boyfriend and now I'm fine. God knows it won't be like this for the rest of the week - or tonight, even - but whatever. I can't really finish this entry properly now. Just know that I miss my mom so much, and that I want to go home, and that I wish neurotypical people were better at communicating directly rather than just sort of being passive-aggressive about it. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    No end note because I'm tired and already did one.

                    Hi. Literally cannot emphasize enough how terrible things are right now. I am effectively out of a source of money for summer semester and I have a 7-swipe meal plan, so. It's time to forcibly diet, I suppose.
                </p>

                    My friend's birthday is tomorrow, so I'm going to make tteokbokki for everyone with fish cakes and green onions and possibly some dumplings and sausage if I can afford it with whatever I have left in my account. I'm also going on a day trip on Friday which I wish I could be excited about if it wasn't for how expensive it's going to be, inevitably.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I'm not religious, but if you are, please keep me in your prayers. Sigh. I understand that things will be okay in the end, but it can be so difficult to believe sometimes.

                    I survived my seven page essay... I have another, 2000 word paper due in three days, but it's about homebrewing in Dungeons and Dragons, so I should probably be fine. I'm not too worried or concerned about it, especially since I'm worldbuilding a personal project right now.

                    It's funny seeing my last blog entry after all that. I was really going through it. But, like I thought: everything was alright in the end. None of this is important, though. What <em>is</em> important, is that:
                </p>
                <p>
                    I'm back at home!!! <i class="kao-happihappi"></i> Life is good when my parents pay for all my food, and I don't have a roommate... not that my roommate is awful, I just enjoy having a room to myself.
                </p>
                <p>I do have to start confronting my fear of being alone in the dark again, though, <em>because</em> I don't have a roommate. I'll be fine either way. I'm excited to get back to campus after this short break though (I'm doing a summer semester so that I can graduate early!) because I'll be rooming with one of my best friends. I love her a lot. I feel as if - despite the clear differences in our personalities, especially with her being much more sociable than me, I think - she's one of the few people on Earth who understands me as much as a normal person can understand me.</p>
                <p>Also, I'm not framing myself as 'weird' as a way to make myself sound special. I'm not. I'm just bizarre, and eccentric, and just a little bit off of my rocker, and I've known this for a long time, but there isn't anything wrong with that. I'm just different, not better or worse than anyone, and that's okay, I think. Probably.</p>
                <p>
                    I'm different, but I'm as unsure of myself as anyone else... haha!

                    I'm at the tail end of my second semester in college, about to finish my 'first year' here - excluding the summer semester that's starting in three weeks or so. I'll have a week or two of break before I'm thrust back into an academic nightmare, but I'll enjoy my downtime while I can. It's brutal out here.

                <p>
                    I recently went on a trip to the American midwest with my boyfriend to meet some of his family and to watch the solar eclipse. I had a lot of fun - I wasn't expecting to fare so well socially as sociability isn't a trait I particularly excel in, but I got along really awesomely with everyone I wanted to get along with. The eclipse itself was mesmerizing and provided a lot of inspiration for an original universe I'm working on, but I think I was more interested in the goat cheese we were eating at the time. In hindsight, I probably should have been paying more attention in the moments leading up to totality.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The trip is most likely the most enjoyable event I've experienced this semester besides one of my best friends from home coming to visit for a few days. Grade-wise I've been alright, but I'm really dreading writing two final papers for two different classes, both of which are due in the next week.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I will be fine in the end, though. I'm having fun overall. Hopefully, life will get... less stressful? We'll see... （；´д｀）ゞ

                <p>Hello diary, I'm back. I don't really know if I want to use proper grammar or not. Usually, I really have
                    only typed in lowercase, but as I've grown older I've started to capitalize my phrases more and more. I'm
                    not sure if it's a sign of maturity or not. I think I'm just growing into a different person. <img
                        src="https://files.catbox.moe/aysu5e.gif"></p>
                <p>That is honestly kind of a scary thing to say. I've been thinking about growing up a lot lately, moreso than
                    I usually do. I'm unsure if I touched upon this in the last entry, but I definitely at least said something
                    similar. Coming to terms with growing up is something I've really grappled with since I gained
                    consciousness, really. I don't know what it means to be an adult. And I understand - all adults are just
                    children pretending to know what they're doing, or at least that's what people, but that doesn't change that
                    I still feel unprepared to go out into the world on my own.</p>
                <p>I recently discovered that the Chiikawa theme song is on Spotify, and just today I've listened to it
                    twenty-seven times. Chiikawa is a Japanese children's show starring a little bear and his two best friends,
                    a yellow rabbit and a cat with blue ears, playing out in the forest and going on little adventures. I am
                    fond of it, despite not having the time to watch it regularly. This isn't a particularly anomalous
                    occurrence; I don't have the time to watch TV at all. And I think that is part of what tears me up most
                    about it.</p>
                <p>Ignorance and naivety are two traits that I admire deeply. I want to be stupid and small again. I very often
                    wish I was a little bear running about with a rabbit and a cat by my side, both of whom are equally clueless
                    about the world's many cruelties: loans, grades, and the job market.</p>
                <p class="blockquote">What, is it already morning? I'm talking to myself. I spread butter on the toasted
                    bread...

                    childhood - but that's always plagued me, so i'm not sure why now would be much different...
                </p>
                <p>
                    i'll be okay in the end, though, regardless of how things might be now. that's always been my
                    philosophy: things will always be okay in the end, and if they aren't okay, then it's not the end. i
                    think it's a pretty great philosophy to go by, and it's gotten me through many very difficult times.
                </p>
                <p>
                    for now, here is a list of things i am grateful for: <b>my boyfriend, Whole Foods' $3 strawberry
                        shortcake cups, my new loft bed, the rain, oil pastels, and rei ayanami/kaworu nagisa's monologue in
                        the End of Evangelion.</b>
                </p>
                <p class="blockquote">
                    We are the hope that people will one day understand each other and we are the words 'I love you.'
