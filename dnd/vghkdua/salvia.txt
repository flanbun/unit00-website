                <p>Regarding someone of interest to you,</p>

<p>Names used are the names told. No one uses a name not given that day. Disrespecting this will result in immediate withdrawal of all trust placed in your organization.</p>

<p>We respect the right of your organization to hold self defense items if ours is given equal treatment. Self defense items should be permitted at all times if the other party also has any self defense items, which also include security guards and unarmed forces as well as any weapons. Such a precaution is unfortunate, but unimportant if your words are honest and your intentions good.</p>

<p>Please maintain an atmosphere of tranquility for our safety and your own. This important person should not be revealed to be important to anyone but individuals to which the importance directly concerns to prevent any unwanted commotion.</p>

<p>Thank you for your understanding. We are optimistic about this meeting.</p>

<p>Nariko Akeoko</p>
