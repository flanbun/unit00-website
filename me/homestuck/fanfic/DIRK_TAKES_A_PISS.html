      <blockquote class="userstuff">
        <p>You, DIRK STRIDER, have needed to urinate since approximately 10AM. That was around four hours ago. There are
          no working restrooms in this realm of literature due to somebody taking a shit equivalent to a weapon of mass
          destruction in the men’s restroom, so the only comfort rooms nearby are outside the front doors and settled in
          a corridor in between a GameStop and a Uniqlo. Once you're freed from the shackles of work that capitalism has
          placed upon you, you're pretty much raring to go and take a piss.</p>
        <p>BUT. (Colors invert, image flips vertically.) You make a tragic mistake.</p>

    <div class="userstuff">
      <p class="narrative">The reality of working at a bookstore is not as romantic as you may think.</p>
      <p class="narrative"> </p>
      <p class="narrative">Like, OK. You can agree that it’s pretty fucking sick to be in close proximity to the modern
        Library of Alexandria, VA, also known as Barnes and Noble, at all times, susceptible to their common overstocks
        of obscure shoujo manga that they so dutifully pass onto you when no one buys off the last few bits. It’s pretty
        sick to have a cafe that serves Starbucks in-store. It’s pretty sick to work in a store so large and so full of
        labyrinthian shelves.</p>
      <p class="narrative"> </p>
      <p class="narrative">The aisles are excellent hiding material, actually. They’re how you spent a solid third of
        your shift today, the part not occupied by dealing with customers who either misread your nametag and called you
        Dick instead of your proper moniker, <span class="dirk"> <b>Dirk</b> </span> or who not-so-subtly flirted with
        you and casted salacious glances at your admittedly fat ass. Well, maybe not fat. More like… muscular. “Fat” is
        better reserved for <span class="jake"> <b>someone else</b></span>.</p>
      <p class="narrative"> </p>
      <p class="narrative">Anyway, the back of the children’s section is a pretty comfy area; usually sparsely
        populated. The rugs are expectedly softer than the carpet and hardwood around the rest of the store, and make
        for a nice cushion substitute to plant your ass on while you adroitly defile another poor copy of <span
          class="text"><a href="https://archiveofourown.org/works/2427119" rel="nofollow">Pony Pals</a></span> with
        glittery neon orange gel pen for your personal enjoyment. </p>
      <p class="narrative"> </p>
      <p class="text">
        <b>THE LABELING MACHINE: stolen. </b>
      </p>
      <p class="narrative"> </p>
      <p class="text">
        <b>MAISIE FROM THE REGISTERS: aggravated. </b>
      </p>
      <p class="narrative"> </p>
      <p class="dirk">

          DEPICTION OF EQUINE YAOI ROMANCE: Crocker is going to fucking love this.</b>
      </p>
      <p class="narrative"> </p>
      <p class="narrative">Plus, unwelcome encounters are typically kept to a minimum while you’re implanted in the
        furthest ring of the store. There’s the exception of the little girl with great taste who stumbled upon you and
        asked what the blatantly phallic shape you were drawing was, and you had to pass it off as a flower in training,
        but you didn’t really mind her at all. She was chill. Amaya, good luck with your horseback lessons on Saturday
        at 9:45 AM. You can wake up early. I believe in you.</p>
      <p class="narrative"> </p>
      <p><span class="narrative">You’re better suited for the back, anyway. Try to walk to the front, and your shitty
          manager, this dumbass camp gay man named Broderick who walks around with his collar popped and guns out like
          it ain’t no thang, will put you on greeting duty with zero chance of argument. It’s to add a welcoming
          atmosphere to the branch, apparently, and to strengthen relationships with the shops around you because the
        </span> <span class="jake"> <b>total Adonis from GameStop</b> </span> <span class="narrative"> just loves
          smiling at you and trying to be the best distraction he possibly can for whatever fucking reason. This is
          where your problem begins.</span></p>
      <p class="narrative"> </p>
      <p class="narrative">See, every man and woman and person of unspecified gender identity has their basic human
        needs. You are not exempt to this, as much as you would like to be. They are as listed.</p>
      <p class="narrative"> </p>

        approximately 10AM. That was around four hours ago. There are no working restrooms in this realm of literature
        due to <em> somebody </em> taking a shit equivalent to a weapon of mass destruction in the men’s restroom, so
        the only comfort rooms nearby are outside the front doors and settled in a corridor in between a GameStop and a
        Uniqlo. Stepping within 30 feet of the entrance leading in from the mall will no doubt result in your boss
        appearing the fuck out of nowhere like he usually does and peer pressuring your poor ass into being the store’s
        resident People Person, which you, by all means, most definitely are not. You don’t feel like putting on your
        shittiest “Cheesed to meet you” grin and saying hello to every disinterested schmuck who happens to so much as
        stick their nose past the divide between the mall’s concrete and the bookstore’s hardwood floors, so you’re left
        to the harrowing duty of developing a kidney stone. </p>
      <p class="narrative"> </p>
      <p class="narrative">Holy shit. You’re not into this stuff. Wetting your pants. Watersports. Omorashi, as some of
        notably exotic/poor tastes may call it. The good ol’ golden shower is not your preferred mode of ablutions. As
        you sit up against a shelf of SAT/PSAT study materials with a vandalized copy of <span class="text"><em> The
            Girl Who Hated Ponies (Pony Pals #13) </em></span> by Jeanne Betancourt clutched to your chest and your eyes
        trained on the clock on the opposite wall, the aching pain of pee held in for the past century and then some
        begins to permeate your abdomen. You reiterate: you are not into this stuff. Maybe if you were just half a
        percent kinkier and physically able to, you would pop a boner at this. But you are not.</p>

        through the rounds of geriatric bed-wetting prevention at the age of twenty. Maybe this is your mid-life crisis.
        Maybe you’re gonna die of kidney failure at forty from a stone the size of a golf ball. No, that’s undershooting
        it. A baseball. A football. You’re going to get stuck in the casket with extraneous flabs of skin jutting out of
        your sides after your abdomen’s been stretched like a keloid scar and you’ll look like Violet Beauregarde. No
        offense to the gal, but you are <em> not </em>up to becoming a blueberry. Inflation is not your thing. You’re

        up the B&amp;N ranks with this kind of constant passive aggression. Maybe… bookkeeping is more hardcore than you
        thought. Or this is his weird way of showing that he cares about you. Or maybe this is an example of his passion

        front of the urinals, but you, being a man of alternative preference, decide to make yourself at home in the
        furthest stall from the door. You stride (pun intended) down there with no shame, slowing your pace for the sake

        <em> sucks </em> , yo. Classes. Assignments that drive you up until 3 AM and then some. It’s just rinse and

        bringing those around her down, but also just enough to show that she’s not a coldblooded bitch with no regard
        for one of her besties for the resties. Roxy, on the other hand, is waterfalling it up like a Six Flags

      <p class="narrative">Auntie Anne’s frozen lemonade mixers are good. Specifically the mango ones. </p>
      <p class="narrative"> </p>
      <p class="narrative">You’re about twenty dollars less wealthy, but the horde of vital information you’ve obtained
        is priceless.</p>
      <p class="narrative"> </p>
      <p class="narrative">You find out that the Discord mod heartthrob is named <span class="jake"><b>JAKE
            ENGLISH</b></span> , and that he hails from New Zealand and moved to the States for college last year. He
        doesn’t actually enjoy video games all that much -- more of a film guy, apparently. You manage to wrestle an
        admission of cerulean-philia from him after he went off on a tangent about the Avatar franchise, which you
        denounced forthwith. He pouted at you and called you a <span class="jake"><b>party pooper</b></span>, and you
        revealed that you carry that title with an unhealthy amount of pride. </p>
      <p class="narrative"> </p>
      <p class="narrative">This is going much better than you expected. He’s not awkward. Mostly. Usually. At least not
        more than you are, and that’s good because if he was, you guys would have spoken in circles like one of those
        mini spinny carousel shits at the playground that Roxy made you hop on last week and spun you around at Mach 10
        until you felt like your brains were blended and that there was a strawberry smoothie fresh in your cranium for
        the slurping. Stick a straw in that bitch and Jamba Juice would have its newest rival in terms of sugary drinks.
        1k calories, but you get an instant transformation into an alpha male because of it. Dope.</p>
      <p class="narrative"> </p>
      <p class="narrative">That metaphor ran away from you. You cross your legs and lean back on the couch that you guys
        are seated on in front of the Auntie Anne’s kiosk, and watch him dip a pretzel bite into caramel sauce. He’s
        somehow gotten sauce all over his fingers. He licks it up. Nasty. What has he touched with those?</p>
      <p class="narrative"> </p>
      <p class="narrative">He’s nice, though. Sweet. Not cis, either, from what he hinted at when he said that you two
        are of the same strand, but he rushed to clarify that he does have a weenie, but he’s not exactly a man. You’re
        just not gonna question it. What matters is that he fits into your T4T preferences.</p>
      <p class="narrative"> </p>
      <p class="narrative">You have other pressing questions, though.</p>
