                    I have finally released Unit-00 V2! I found myself sort of falling out of love with V1, so on a whim I started coding V2 - partially to satisfy myself, and partially to procrastinate on an assignment... :')
                </p>
                <p>
                    I had something planned for Karkat day, but it might be late. Sorry!
                </p>
                <p>
                    Mind the dust while I rebuild! (｡･∀･)ﾉﾞAs of now, the only functioning pages are Index, Home, Newsletter, Not_found, and the Homestuck and OC sections (taken from V1).
                </p>

                    With this update, I'm trying to do the following: provide a cleaner, faster-loading viewer experience (as fast as I can make the page load using external filehosts, sorry), better organize the files on this site, and finally, just make this site more true to myself overall. It's nice making a cute site, but I don't think the last layout really represented me as a person - it was just a site that I found cute rather than a site that's me.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Let's hope this version goes a little better! I also plan on transitioning to longer-form text updates that don't occur with every site update like last time. It was a bit tiring trying to keep up with that previously.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Thanks for loving my site! If you're new here, welcome and I hope you enjoy! You can view previous versions of my site on the Web Archive. :)
