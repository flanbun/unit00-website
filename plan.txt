========================

LOOKING FOR

+ minimal (less clutter, use more folders)
+ simple, less img heavy design
+ USE /data/ FOLDER - host images on site
itself - NO MORE HOTLINKING
+ use grids where possible, less flexboxes
+ redesign blog
+ redesign artgal

========================

ISSUES W/ CURRENT LAYOUT

+ odd color palette - cute but not cohesive. focus
more on black + white with bright accent colors

+ everything is busy in a way that isnt fun. theres
a way to balance busy and negative space that DOESNT
look like this.

+ make it messy in a nice way
